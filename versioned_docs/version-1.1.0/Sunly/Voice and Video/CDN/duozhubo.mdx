## Introduction

Docusaurus will help you ship a beautiful documentation site in no time.

Building a custom tech stack is expensive. Instead, focus on your content and just write Markdown files.

Check the best Docusaurus sites for inspiration and read some testimonials.

Docusaurus is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation 
features but can be used to create any kind of site (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).


### gatsby

Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content.

GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides.

Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative.

Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.

# Next.js
Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box.

Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.

# VuePress
VuePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric website and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VuePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a decent choice.

# MkDocs
MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus.

It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React.

Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme.

# Docsify
Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly.

# GitBook
GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here.

Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone.

# Jekyll
Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use â€” in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll.

In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using <script /> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up.
